# Drowsiness-Detection-System
Road accidents from driver fatigue are a major safety risk. This project presents a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using image processing and machine learning. Metrics like Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Mouth Opening Ratio (MOR) and  Nose Length Ratio (NLR) are analyzed, achieving 95.58% sensitivity. Alerts like audio alarms enhance road safety.
